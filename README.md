# Introduction

**Chess Game**

**This software was made by Bogdan Alexandru Ciurea**

**Student Name: Bogdan Alexandru Ciurea**

This is a **personal project** that was the purpose of showing my skills in writing object-oriented code in C++ but also to show my interest in graphical applications.

# The software

## Used software
The presented software has been made using:
 - C++
 - Raylib (for graphics)
 - stackedit.io (for formatting the `.md` files)

## About the files
The project has the following structure:
```
├── assets
├── include
│   ├── cell.h
│   ├── cell_position.h
│   ├── chess.h
│   ├── chess_board.h
│   ├── move.h
│   ├── movement.h
│   ├── pieces.h
│   ├── raylib.h
│   ├── utils.h
├── lib
│   ├── libraylib.a
├── src
│   ├── cell.cpp
│   ├── cell_position.cpp
│   ├── chess_board.cpp
│   ├── functions.cpp
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── pieces.cpp
├── README.md
├── Makefile
├── FORMATTING.md
```

The folder named `assets` will contains the images and sounds for this project.
The file named `FORMATTING.md` has the coding standards that I've used. They criteria of choosing these coding standards was how I found fit.

## How to run this project

On **Linux** this project is still in development.

On **Windows**  you will need to run the Makefile and this would result in an `.exe` file being created.
